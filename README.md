# JavaScript Package
This is a starter repo for Node packages I publish, to start faster and with best practices and defaults ready to use.

## Contributing
Contributions are incredibly welcome as long as they are standardly applicable and pass the tests (or break bad ones). Tests are written in AVA.

```bash
# running tests
npm run test
```
