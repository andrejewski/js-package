# JavaScript Package

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/andrejewski/js-package.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)
This is a starter repo for Node packages I publish, to start faster and with best practices and defaults ready to use.

## What's in the box!?
- [Standard](https://github.com/feross/standard) and [Fixpack](https://github.com/henrikjoreteg/fixpack) for enforcing style
- [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava) for testing
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) ready to roll
- [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) for building the project

## Contributing
Contributions are incredibly welcome as long as they are standardly applicable and pass the tests (or break bad ones). Tests are in AVA.

```bash
# running tests
npm run test
```
